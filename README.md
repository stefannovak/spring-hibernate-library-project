This is my final project on my Library app I have been developing

I started it on 20/04/2019 after my Hibernate app. As soon as I developed that I knew I needed to turn it into a user-friendly interactive experience online. 

My plans are to implement full CRUD capabilities and perhaps a user authentication system. I'm using w3 CSS templates to help save time on the website design so I can fully use my time improving my Java Spring skills.
